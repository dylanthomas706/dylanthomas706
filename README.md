I like to describe myself as an economic analyst that you'd call about programming if you didn't know anyone else. I have experience using R and Python to analyze large public and private datasets. My favorite thing to do in R is to build complex heat maps and my favorite thing to do in my Python is read the discussion pages on [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com).
